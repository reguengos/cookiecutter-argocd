# $1 path to root of YAML files / or single file

#
# kbld-digest
# -----------
#
# Finds all YAML files in the gimanifesten path - the path may also point to a single file -
# then passes each file through `kbld`, which replaces image tags (nginx:latest)
# with the image *digest*; adding annotations is turned off.
#
# Since `kbld` does not support working on files in-place, the "digested" file is written to disk,
# the original is then remomanifested and the "digested" file put in its place.
#
# Usage:
#
#   kbld-digest /path/to/manifests
#   kbld-digest /path/to/file.yaml
#


manifests=()
mapfile -t manifests < <(find "${1}" -name '*.yaml')

for manifest in "${manifests[@]}"; do
    printf "%s/n" "${manifest}"
    kbld --file="${manifest}" --images-annotation=false > "${manifest}.digested"
    mv -v "${manifest}.digested" "${manifest}"
done
